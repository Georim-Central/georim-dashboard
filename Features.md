# Georim Features

This version is based only on what currently exists in the project right now.

How this file is organized:
- Features are grouped by pricing tier.

- Each bullet is tagged with its page.
- Suggested additions are kept at the very bottom.

Important:
- `Premium` and `Business / Enterprise` are paid tiers.

- This repo is frontend-focused right now.
