# Georim Features

This version is based only on what currently exists in the project right now.

How this file is organized:
- Features are grouped by pricing tier.
- Inside each tier, features are grouped by the page where they exist now.
- Each bullet is tagged with its page.
- Suggested additions are kept at the very bottom.

Important:
- `Premium` and `Business / Enterprise` are paid tiers.
- `Business / Enterprise` should include everything in `Premium`.
- This repo is still a frontend MVP, so the features below describe the current product experience in the UI.
